Exception is an event that occurs during the execution of the program
It disrupts the normal program flow
It creates Exception object , which contain information about Error like:
-Type of Exception and Message
-Stack Trace etc
RunTime system use this Exception Object and find the class which can handle it

When Exception comes...Exception object is created

If no one can handle the Exception , RunTime system terminate the program abruptly and print stack
trace

From where the problem happens till the starting point=>Stack Trace

Topmost Parent Class is Object
Child class is Throwable
=>Error
=>Exception

Diff b/w Error(not able to control) and Exception(can handle and control the program)

Error (JVM issues)
-Out of Memory Error=>Cannot create no more objects in Heap
-Stack Overflow
